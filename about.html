<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Monica and I am a Fourth year Computer Science Engineering student at Saveetha Engineering college.<br >
    Web pages and analyzing data always intrigued me, hence I am planning to pursue my career in that direction.<br >
    I have learnt Data analytics techniques and also data analysis and visualization methods. Tools like using coal by google and Hadoop has given me a good start with implementation as well. I have also learnt to built HTML pages and learning CSS,JS for the full functionality of web pages. I am keen to learn concepts using tableau and minitab in the future.<br >
    I am grateful for  an opportunity to experience data analyst from live environment by being part of learning community. This will immensely help me laying a good foundation for my career.<br >
    I find this will help me as a learning platform for my existing skills to develop into its most advanced form and help me in learning new domains too.<br >
    I currently have 8.93/10 CGPA in my semesters so far, that reflects my work on the field that Iâ€™ve chosen and I am willing to learn other languages if required for the role.<br >
    My academic experiences have served me well in developing my collaboration and communication skills. I work well to use clear and concise communication to interact professionally.
